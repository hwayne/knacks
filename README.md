# Knacks

A "knack" is a small skill or trick you can learn that is useful in niche circumstances. Some example knacks are

1. Knowing the NATO phonetic alphabet
2. Being able to accurately time a minute in your head
3. Knowing times tables bigger than 12x12
4. Memory palaces

I find knacks really interesting and am often trying to learn them. This is a list of programs I've written to help me develop knacks, or otherwise put useful processes into my day-to-day life.
